# 🛡️ Update a File through a Python Algorithm

This project is part of the Coursera **Cybersecurity Professional Certificate (Course 7)**. It demonstrates my ability to write Python code that reads, processes, and updates file data — a critical skill in cybersecurity automation.

## 📄 Project Description

In a healthcare company, access to restricted content is controlled via a file that stores an allow list of IP addresses. Some IPs must be removed from this list regularly based on a `remove_list`. I developed a Python script to automate this process.

The algorithm:
- Opens the `allow_list.txt` file
- Reads and parses the content
- Removes IP addresses found in `remove_list`
- Updates the file with the new list using `.write()`

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated
- File handling with `open()`, `.read()`, and `.write()`
- String manipulation with `.split()` and `.join()`
- Looping with `for` and conditional logic with `if`
- Use of `.remove()` method to delete data from a list
- Writing clear, documented Python code

## 📁 Files Included
- `file_update_script.py` – Python script that performs the file update
- `Update_File_Algorithm_Portfolio_Report.docx` – Portfolio write-up with code explanations and context

## ✅ Status
Completed and submitted on Coursera with a score of **100%**.
